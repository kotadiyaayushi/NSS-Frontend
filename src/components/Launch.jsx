                      The National Service Scheme was launched in 1969 under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, with the aim of inculcating a sense of social service among students. CHARUSAT embraced this vision by establishing its NSS Unit, bringing together enthusiastic volunteers committed to social welfare. Over the years, our unit has expanded, undertaking diverse projects that align with national objectives, such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Fit India Movement, and Blood Donation Drives.
